# dsh-etl-search-ai-2025
## About The Project

This solution is a dataset search and discovery platform designed to demonstrate modern **Clean Architecture** and **Semantic Search** capabilities.

[cite_start]The system is designed to ingest metadata and supporting documents from the **CEH Catalogue Service** , process them into vector embeddings, and allow users to discover data using natural language queries.

Key capabilities include:
* **Automated ETL Pipeline**: Extracts ISO 19115 metadata, JSON-LD, and supporting documents from remote archives.
* **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings to find datasets based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.
* **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Enhances search results by retrieving context from supporting documents.
* **Conversational UI**: A Svelte-based frontend allowing users to interact with data via an AI agent.
