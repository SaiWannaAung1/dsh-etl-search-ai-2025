To implement this specific dependency chain in GitHub Actions, we use **Jobs** and the `needs` keyword. This ensures that the frontend build only starts if the backend is stable, and tests only run against a verified build.

### 🔍 Explanation of the Pipeline Logic

#### **The Dependency Chain**

1. **`backend-integration`**: This is your "Base Layer." If the C# API logic is broken, there is no point in building the frontend.
2. **`frontend-build`**: Uses `needs: backend-integration`. It compiles the Svelte 5 code. We use `upload-artifact` to save the production-ready code.
3. **`frontend-testing`**: Uses `needs: frontend-build`. This job downloads the compiled code.
* **Unit/Integration Tests:** Runs Vitest against your ViewModels and Components.
* **E2E Integration:** Runs Playwright to ensure the "View" correctly navigates and interacts with the build.

### 🛠️ Why we use `upload-artifact`?

In GitHub Actions, every **Job** runs on a brand new, clean Virtual Machine.

* When the `frontend-build` job finishes, its files are deleted.
* By "Uploading" the build, we pass the compiled code to the `frontend-testing` machine so it doesn't have to rebuild the project, saving time and ensuring we are testing the **exact same files** that will go to production.

### ⚙️ How to see this in GitHub

Once you push this file:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Click on the running workflow.
3. You will see a visual graph where arrows point from the Backend to the Build, and from the Build to the Tests.

**Would you like me to add a step to this workflow that automatically creates a "Test Report" summary on your Pull Request if any tests fail?**
