| 1  | Based on attach document, I need to design a dataset search and discovery platform consisting of: an ETL subsystem for extracting metadata and documents from the CEH Catalogue Service, a relational metadata store (SQLite), a semantic vector database for embeddings, and a web application frontend Svelte that supports semantic and conversational search. Please propose: A high-level system architecture diagram (described dot line diagram) , The main components and their responsibilities, The data flow between components (dotted line diagram), Key architectural decisions and trade-offs.

For each step, specify: which layer is being implemented (Core, Infrastructure, Application/Use Cases, API, Tests), the exact files to create in that step, the order in which those files should be implemented, and how tests are introduced alongside the implementation to keep CI/CD passing at every stage. The output should describe a step-by-step implementation roadmap that allows generating and validating the code in small parts rather than all at once.
