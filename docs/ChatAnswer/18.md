Since we split the tests into two separate projects (UnitTests and IntegrationTests), the GitHub Actions workflow needs to be updated. It should now run the unit tests first (for fast feedback) and then the integration tests.

Here is the updated .github/workflows/ci.yml:

name: DSH CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      # Spin up Qdrant for Integration Tests
      qdrant:
        image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
        ports:
          - 6333:6333

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Use .NET 10 Preview (or 8.0 if you decided to downgrade)
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with:
          dotnet-version: '10.0.x'
          dotnet-quality: 'preview'

      - name: Restore Dependencies
        # Restore the whole solution to catch any missing package issues
        run: dotnet restore ./backend/DshEtlSearch.sln

      - name: Build Solution
        run: dotnet build ./backend/DshEtlSearch.sln --no-restore --configuration Release

      # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # 1. Run Unit Tests (Fast, Memory only)
      # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: dotnet test ./backend/DshEtlSearch.UnitTests/DshEtlSearch.UnitTests.csproj --no-build --verbosity normal

      # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # 2. Run Integration Tests (Slower, uses Docker services)
      # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        run: dotnet test ./backend/DshEtlSearch.IntegrationTests/DshEtlSearch.IntegrationTests.csproj --no-build --verbosity normal
Why this structure?
    Explicit Project Paths: We point directly to .csproj files. This avoids any ambiguity if the solution file (.sln) format causes issues with the runner.
    Order of Operations: Unit tests run first. If logic is broken, the pipeline fails fast (in seconds) without waiting for the slower integration tests (which spin up DB contexts and HTTP clients).
    One Workflow, Two Checkpoints: You can easily see in the GitHub Actions UI which step failed—was it a logic bug (Unit Test) or a database/docker issue (Integration Test)?

Next Step
You can now proceed to implement Task 1.2 (SQLite Repository). Would you like me to generate the code for that?
