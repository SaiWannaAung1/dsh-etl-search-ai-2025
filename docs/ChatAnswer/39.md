| 1  | "1 Based on attach document, I need to design a dataset search and discovery platform consisting of: an ETL subsystem for extracting metadata and documents from the CEH Catalogue Service, a relational metadata store (SQLite), a semantic vector database for embeddings, and a web application frontend Svelte that supports semantic and conversational search. Please propose: A high-level system architecture diagram (described dot line diagram) , The main components and their responsibilities, The data flow between components (dotted line diagram), Key architectural decisions and trade-offs.

| 3  | Firstly, I want to discuss data flow diagrams. Looking at the data flow diagram, I want to optimize memory usage and performance. Which data stores or processes could benefit from caching, and how can we implement efficient ETL algorithms to minimize server load while keeping data retrieval fast?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 12 | Based on the provided Clean Architecture–based project structure, break the implementation into small, incremental Agile steps suitable for AI-assisted development. For each step, specify: which layer is being implemented (Core, Infrastructure, Application/Use Cases, API, Tests), the exact files to create in that step, the order in which those files should be implemented, and how tests are introduced alongside the implementation to keep CI/CD passing at every stage. The output should describe a step-by-step implementation roadmap that allows generating and validating the code in small parts rather than all at once. Generate as a file structurer format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

According to my debugging, the problem is cannot read the docx and pdf file because they are generating by raw bit after extraction from zip file.
